# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Improve module-list metadata, MIT license detection, and installation/update documentation.
- Add ESLint, Dependabot, a code of conduct, and updated GitHub Actions checks.
- Add `character: "tora"` for the classic striped cat, using the original cat masks.
- Add optional `character: "dog"` with bundled classic oneko dog sprites;
  `"cat"` remains the default. Both characters share behavior and notifications.
- Add `NEKO_GO_TO_REGION` to walk to a named standard MagicMirror region, with
  viewport fallback for empty regions, resize handling, and lifecycle-safe queuing.
